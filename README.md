A beginner-level C++ project that covers core programming concepts, marking the first step in learning the C++ language.

This repo is my first C++ milestone project. It has allowed me to understand:

1. Input handling  
2. Functions  
3. Filtering and sorting (using bubble sort)  
4. Basic aggregation

## How to Run
1. **Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Saifullah005/cpp-student-filter-project.git
